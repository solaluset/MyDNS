<p align="center">Use your local DNS server on Android</p>

## Disclaimer
I'm not an expert in Android nor in bash scripting.
The module was made mainly for personal use, all this can be done in 5 lines of code, the rest was added for flexibility.
If you have suggestions or improvements, don't hesitate to open an issue or pull request.

This module allows you to:
- Run your local DNS server with any configuration
